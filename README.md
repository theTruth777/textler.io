# textler.io

textler.io is a web based markdown editor, for writing and editing markdown files. It also gives you the option to export download your final result as a markdown or html file.

## Getting Started

If you want to setup the project on your local machine, you need to follow the following steps:

### Prerequisites

In order to run textler.io on you machine you need yarn. Yarn is a dependency manager.

Once all dependencies are satisfied, you can launch the local node server by running the following command:

After that, the local server will launch and listen to requests coming in from port 3000.
