# textler.io

textler.io is a web based markdown editor for writing and editing markdown files. It also gives you the option to download your final result as a markdown or html file.

## Getting Started

If you want to setup the project on your local machine, you need to follow the following steps:

### Prerequisites

In order to run textler.io on your machine you will need docker. Docker is a container virtualization software. If you wan't to find out more about docker, take a look at these ressources:

* [About docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker)
* [Install docker on your system](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

You will also need docker-compose. [See this link here to learn more about it](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).


### Installing

Clone the repository to your machine and run the following command from the project root:

```
$ docker-compose build
```
Once the container has been build and all dependencies are satisfied, you have to run the following command to launch the container:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

After that, the container will launch and expose port 3000. You can then open textler.io in your browser, by calling the following url: localhost:3000.


## Deployment

If you want to build textler.io for production, you have to run the following command from the project root:

```
$ yarn build
```

A new folder called "build" will be created, with all files that you need for a production system.
